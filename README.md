Prerequisite:   English 0701 or 0711: Introduction to Academic Discourse or an appropriate English placement.
Course Overview:
Analytical Reading and Writing is a foundation course in the General Education program.    English 0812 is designed for students whose primary language is not English, and who are either placed into or given the option of an ESL-inflected section of freshman composition. As a General Education course, the goal of this course is to introduce students to the strategies, conventions, habits of mind, and research methods used in academic reading and writing.
Although Eng0812 is a themed course, the primary purpose is to help students become familiar with the complex demands of college writing, especially argumentation, research, evaluation of sources, and synthesis of materials. The theme of this section of English 0812 is Communication. This theme will provide a sense of direction and coherence to the semester’s work, and it should serve to motivate and inspire students as they explore intellectually challenging questions.
Note.
This is an ESL section of Analytic Reading and Writing.    Native English speakers should be aware that the credits earned in this course may not   be transferable to other American universities.
This class will be taught in person:
Class will meet in Room 304

1. Attendance ProtocolAttendance is required in this course because attendance is crucial to your success. Attendance will be taken in every class not only to encourage maximum participation in the course but also to facilitate outreach from student services and/or academic support units when needed.
Qwickly, a Canvas app, will be used to record attendance. A PIN will be provided during class to enable your check-in. Failure to check in on time will be recorded as an absence or tardiness. Three late “arrivals” to (or early “departures” from) class will be considered as one absence. Main Campus attendance policy states that more than four (three in TTH classes) unexcused, or excused, absences will result in failure of the course.   When you are absent, it is your responsibility to check   Canvas and TU email   for any   class   related communication   and to catch up with the work before the next class meeting.
Although reasonable accommodations will be made during a period of absences due to an illness or other extraordinary circumstances, a withdrawal from the course may be advised should you miss more than 25% (double the allowable absences) of the class meetings.2.   EssaysIn all Analytical Reading and Writing classes, students are required to complete three multiple–draft essays. The essay topics for this class are as follows:
Essay 1: Evaluation (900-1200 words)    
The essay goals are (a) to summarize and evaluate a class reading and (b) to take a position on the ideas presented in the readings. In this class you will achieve this goal by writing a critical evaluation of one author’s argument. This essay assignment does not require research.
Essay 2: Synthesis and Argument (950-1350 words)
The essay goals are (a) to formulate a narrow, open question on the theme of the course, (b) to make meaningful make connections across research sources to support a specific argument and (c) to demonstrate control of logic, transition and connections. This essay assignment requires research.
Essay 3: Synthesis and Argument (1350-1750 words)
In addition to the research and synthesis goals for Essay 2, in Essay 3 students should demonstrate their ability to (a) defend a position taken on an open issue related to the theme of the course, (b) anticipate and respond to opposing views, and (c) develop and sustain a coherent evidence-based argument. This essay is similar to a final exam in the sense that you will have to demonstrate control and mastery of many of the skills taught during the course including the MLA style, logical organization, synthesis, and coherence.   This essay assignment requires research.
Essay 4: Reflective Essay (Minim 500 words)
The essay goals are (a) to show an awareness of your learning process and (b) to discuss your growth as a writer in the course.
3. Writing Process
All FYWP classes will follow the same writing process:a.   DraftsStudents should complete at least 3 drafts for each required essay and follow through the steps below:1.   Draft 1: Instructor’s comments and Peer Review workshop2.   Draft 2: Instructor’s comments, conference, and in-progress grade.3.   Draft 3: Instructor’s comments, conference and in-progress grade (and additional conferences with instructor’s permission, if necessary)4.   Final Draft (submitted with drafts 1, 2 and 3 with instructor’s comments)b.   Peer-review workshopEvery time a first draft is due, you will participate in a peer-review workshop. Guidelines will be provided in class and via Canvas.c.   Reflective paragraph
Together with your second draft, you must submit a one-paragraph self-reflection that discusses your writing process and revisions made based on peer-review or self-evaluation and instructor’s comments. At the end of the semester, you will use ideas from these paragraphs to write the reflective essay for your portfolio.   d.      Conferences
You are required to meet with the instructor for individual conferences at least 3   times during
the term. To facilitate the conference process, classes will be cancelled. Missing a conference
will count as an absence, so if you have to miss a conference, e-mail me before your
conference time, and as soon as you return, make arrangements to schedule a new conference.
Conferences may proceed as follows, with variation across classes:
Conference #1: Discuss Essay 1 Draft 2
Conference #2: Discuss Essay 2 Draft 2 and Essay 1 Draft 3
Conference #3: Discuss Essay 3 Draft 2 and Essay 3 Draft 3   
I am also available during office hours or by appointment, if you wish to meet beyond our conference appointments.   If your draft 3 is unsatisfactory (in-progress grade of below C-), you are strongly encouraged to schedule regular meetings with a TLC tutor and your instructor to receive further support and engage in a more closely guided revision process towards the final draft.
4.    Portfolio and Portfolio Grading Standards
Instead of receiving a grade for each essay, one holistic grade will be awarded for all works included in the final portfolio. This means that all essays included in the portfolio carry the same assessment weight. At the end of the term, your instructor and a second reader will determine your portfolio grade using the main campus Portfolio Grading Standards. This system is used to ensure consistency in grading across all sections of First Year Writing classes. A copy of the Portfolio Grading Standards will be posted on the Canvas course and will be reviewed in class at least twice during the term.
The final portfolio should contain the following items:1.   A self-reflective essay of at least 500 words2.   Final copies of essays 1, 2 and 3, each submitted with:·   Peer or Self-review sheet·   Instructor-commented drafts (and Research proposal when appropriate)·   Reflective paragraphs
The final portfolio is due on the last day of class.   I will give specific instructions on how to organize the items in your electronic portfolio at the end of the term.      
Notes:1.   An incomplete portfolio with significant missing elements or a portfolio turned in with papers that you have never submitted in draft form. will also receive an F (= 0) because you must show your work throughout the semester.
To ensure you have all the materials required for your final portfolio, please keep all electronic copies of instructor-commented drafts organized throughout the term.2.   A portfolio that includes academic honesty violations, will always receive an F (= 0).   Academic honesty violations in the portfolio include but are not limited to (1) falsifying data; (2) disguising someone else’s words, ideas, or other original work as your own or failing to attribute ideas previously expressed in another language to the source; (3) submitting work completed with the use of unauthorized assistance from a person, agency, or machine (e.g., having someone write for you or including machine-translated or AI-generated passages); and (4) submitting work done for another course - including a previous first-year writing course - without instructor’s approval, helping others to plagiarize or cheat from one's own or another's work, or doing the work of another person.

代做程序编程语言ails on Temple’s policy on plagiarism and academic cheating   and in the Canvas Academic Honesty and Plagiarism Module.
Learning how to use someone else’s ideas, words, or data appropriately and avoiding plagiarism is one of the learning outcomes of this course. You must always cite your sources. If you are uncertain about what constitutes plagiarism, consult with your instructor before you hand in your essay, but the following rules will help you avoid plagiarism:
a.   The language in your paper must be either your own or a direct quote from the   original author.
b.   Changing a few words or phrases from another writer’s work is not enough to make the writing “your own.” The writing is either your own or the other person’s; there are no in-betweens.
c.   In-text citations and an accurate bibliography should be used every time you are not expressing your own “words” or “ideas”.
*The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Quillbot, DALL-E, DeepL, Google Translate, etc.) are not permitted in this class; therefore, any use of AI tools for work in this class may be considered a violation of Temple University’s Academic Honesty   policy and Student Conduct of Code, since the work is not your own. The use of generative AI tools is not   permitted in this course for the following activities:   ·   Impersonating you in classroom contexts, such as by using the tool to compose discussion board posts assigned to you.·   Processing entire course texts or passages to produce a summary and to circumvent the act of reading.·   Translating entire course texts or passages to circumvent the act of reading in English.·   Writing entire sentences, paragraphs, essay drafts, or another writing assignment, including discussion board posts, reading assignments, peer-review comments, or groupwork that was assigned to you.·   Composing an assignment in another language and translating it into English.
The use of unauthorized AI tools will result in a zero grade for the first offense and will require resubmission of the assignment along with a reflection. On a repeated violation, the penalty will increase, severe cases resulting in an F for the course grade. The use of any assistance should support your learning and growth as a writer. Consultations with the class instructor, the TLC tutors, and FYWP embedded tutors are generally appropriate forms of assistance. Ask your instructor when you are uncertain whether a certain use of assistive technology is appropriate.On earlier drafts, mistakes in citation or even missteps in academic honesty serve as opportunities for learning. However, serious unintentional plagiarism or breach of academic integrity left unrectified in final drafts are grounds for failing the portfolio.
5. First Year Writing Program Assessment
In order to pass this course and complete your GenEd requirement for Analytical Reading and Writing, you must meet all three   of the following criteria:
1.   Meet the attendance requirements (no more than 4   absences) (no more than 3   absences for TTH classes)
2.   Receive at least a C-   on your portfolio
                                                                     AND3.   Receive at least a C- on other assignments
You must receive a C- (70%) or better as a final grade to successfully complete this course. A D+ and below will require you to retake Eng0812. You must also receive a C- (70%) or better on the final portfolio. In other words, if your portfolio is D+ or lower, you cannot pass this class even if you completed all the other elements of the course, including peer review, homework, and other assignments. Likewise, a passing portfolio grade does not guarantee a passing course grade if you do not obtain at least a C- (70%) from all the other elements of the course, such as revision process activities.
6. Retaking FYWP Courses
Students who receive a course grade below C- should retake the course. Students can retake the course as many times as necessary, but multiple repetitions of the course may delay graduation.
COURSE RULES, REQUIREMENTS, AND ASSESSMENT
1. Class Participation 
Class participation is essential to the successful completion of this course. Completing the relevant assignments before class will prepare you to contribute your ideas to the class discussion and activities. Responsible and active participation by everyone will maximize collaborative learning.Be sure to join each class on time and participate actively throughout the meeting. 1-4 absences (1-3 absences for TTH classes) will not have a direct effect on your grade. However, even a single absence may negatively affect your performance due to foregoing interactive learning through group activities as well as missing important information. Catching up with any missed class work is crucially important. Reasonable accommodations will be made during a period of quarantine or absences due to an illness.
2. Classroom Etiquette
In order to include all students in our diverse community of learners, it is important to foster a respectful and productive learning environment. Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University’s nondiscrimination statement, will add richness to this learning experience. Therefore, all opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse.
Treat your classmates and instructor with respect in all communication, class activities, and meetings. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Please consider that sarcasm, humor and slang can be misconstrued in interactions and generate unintended disruptions. Profanity should be avoided. Remember to be careful with your own and others’ privacy. In general, have your behavior. mirror how you would like to be treated by others.3. Canvas and E-mail
